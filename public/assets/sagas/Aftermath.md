#### Part 1
She might have left the crypt at what she thought was late night but for her it felt like it never ended and that the sunrise never came. The light to the east did come but the joy and happiness that came with the light of day didn't. The heavy steps through the marshes had become her new normal, the one thing she could focus on through her foggy mind and buzzing ears. Just one more step, one foot in front of the other. There were so many moments were she thought she heard people call out to her that got her hopes up that help was nearby but then there was nothing when turning around looking for it. She couldn't persuade herself that it was just the wind since there was no vegetation around that wasn't the reeds and cattails. Worst case scenario something followed her from the crypt, best case would be its just in her head. But thinking that she started hearing things wasn't a comforting thought either. But for her it didn't matter, the sound was enough reason to hurry up. 

She had to go back to her focus on just getting one foot ahead of the other, if she would stop she knew that she would never get going again. As long as one patch of reeds passed her after another. Only thing breaking her pattern would be the annoyance of getting her boots stuck in the mud over and over. It got to the point were thinking that she would get out of there not completely soaked from knees down was an impossible idea. She had to use all of the energy she had gathered from the dirt floor in the crypt to pull her self free, but just the thought of the crypt made her mind foggy again. Her mind repeating over and over what had happened in there. It was as if it couldn't make any sense of what had happened and had to repeat it to analyze every single detail, to find some proof of its truth or hope for that it all didn't happen.

 Over time her body screamed at her for both the anger of wanting rest and the joy over how the ground became easier for each step to walk on, but it shouldn't be easier to walk on. The area around Mosshall was just as bad as what she had just walked through. So for the first time in a a long time she looked up and was faced with a forest. The darkness among the pine trees felt inviting to her but she chocked it up to be only a desperate feeling, one of wanting to see something else than just waterlogged grass, maybe even a feeling of wanting to go home to the comfort of darkness. Fighting against the fog in her head to remember the map of the area, she vaguely remembered that there was only two forests, one to the east and one to the west of the marshes. With nothing else but moonlight to guide her she turned to what she believed to be south and started wandering again. Back to the aching comfort of just another step. Her body screaming back at her for continuing this and her mind screaming at her for just the thought that she have to face the wet marsh again. Her body back to its own trot but so her mind too, with playing up all that has happened again. Making her face the grief and now clearly burnt in memory of them all laying there. Were they really dead? They might not even have died and she just left. Why would she do such a thing? Just leaving them like that, she should have checked them just in case they also survived. Why did she survive? What made her different? There should be no reason why she made it they didn't. But it had gone days, or had it just gone hours? Should she go back herself? Should she just find help, find a priest or just someone that could resurrect them. Yes, resurrect them, there have been stories of such things happening. yes find people to help her bring them back. All thoughts blur together until it becomes the foggy state again. Just a few more steps and then there will be help and then she can come back for them. 

At one moment she was yet again stuck in a patch of muddy waters blinded by the rising sun and then at another moment the light of day was suddenly gone, but why is still wasn't evening? Breaking her focus on her steps and taking a look up and around her. The environment had changed from the empty open fields of Marsh to gigantic mushrooms sprouting and covering her with some shade. The mushrooms was as tall as the great buildings from home, Some of the mushrooms had even a faint glow in their spore gills underneath.


Their great height and the glow combined really reminded her about home. If she would have been with her people all of this wouldn't have happened. Was it really the right choice to leave? Was it all worth it? She has to turn her focus back to the present around her, there is no point for her to think of her past since there is no way to return or undo it all. 

She kept on walking through this mushroom forest for a long time just to savor the moment until reminded from time and time again that she can't share this with [[Characters in the stories#^79803f | Thalis]]. Every time she thought about him she now could only see that burned in image of him on the floor. This time it doesn't go away, making her feelings slowly bubble up inside her. Thinking there must have been something she could have done. There must have been something. No it will be fine since she will return, she will find help and return. She goes to sit down at the stem of one of the mushrooms, desperately trying to remember Thalis that isn't the image from the crypt. His ember eyes, his golden blond hair or his smile... She can't recall his smile anymore. But it have barely been a day, or is it days?

Her stomach taking the opportunity to help her remember by loudly rumbling. She tries to recall when she last ate or even had a break. Everything is just a fog in her mind and giving it a good thought she can't even remember if the buzzing in her ears ever stopped. Resting her head against the stem and looking up to study the gills of the mushroom, spotting that every time the wind gets a hold of the mushrooms small blue spores falls over the area covering it in a ghostly shimmer but also making the whole area smell like wet earthy dirt. The entire area kept pulsing in this glow, growing stronger and weaker, a perfect breathing rhythm. Her breathing falls into the rhythm of the light and her body overcomes with the exhaustion finally closing her eyes for a bit. 

There was no real rest for her during this break, many times she woke up to the buzzing in her ears growing into a loud screech just for it to die down minutes later. If the exhaustion wouldn't kill her she was convinced that the screeching would. A few of these screeching moments wasn't as bad as the others but in its stead there would be voices speaking, small conversations, pleading, screaming and even some laughter. It all blended together as if sitting in the middle of a busy bar, with its constant indistinct conversations but with the odd voice or sound breaking through. If she opens her eyes all she could see was how the spores moved in the wind almost blindingly bright when grouping up. As a distraction she focused on their movement and swirling in the wind, finding patterns and figures. sometimes they were just beautiful swirls, sometimes it looked like people walking past her. it was only there for such a short moment that she could never determine what race or gender they were.

After one particularly bad episode of her ears screeching she decides she has had enough. stretching out her stiff aching body and shaking off as much as possible of the morning dew from her coat possible. The moisture over night and together with the fog that have rolled in now in the early morning have made all of the spores stick to her, making her look like the humanoid figures she saw during the night. trying to remove or scrape off any of the spores that stuck to her only made it worse by smearing it out and making it stick to her clothing even more. After a few tries she gave up and scanned the area around her, with all the fog there was no real help for direction except the general direction of where she sat down. She decided that she cant stay in this fog and just wait so taking the chance of moving in the same direction as she had faced when she sat down. The environment around her changing with the mushrooms growing smaller for every step she takes and them finally being replaced by small shrubbery and willow trees. the sight of the first trees was a pure joy, taking in the new impressions around her, especially the feeling of the hanging branches moving over her shoulders. After spending most of her time on the ground or on the move it was a welcoming feeling of a soft touch. What she couldn't enjoy were the sound of the wind through the leaves. Her hearing had completely been replaced by the buzzing and the ever returning screeching. On her walk through the forest she didn't manage to get far before having to stop and use all of her focus to not scream from the piercing pain of the screeching in her ears. The pain growing to such a degree that just walking would be difficult. This returned over and over again but slowly the time in between the moments of agonizing pain got shorter until it never ended. When she realized that this was the time it wouldn't stop she had no choice but slowly keep moving. At particularly high pitches of the screeching her eyesight got worse and specks of black and white danced across her vision. Through the woods she could spot what looked like a clearing and she took aim for that, if she was gonna die here and now she would want to do it under the open sky. Hopefully whatever god would meet her in the afterlife she wish it would allow her to see thalis again. Her own nagging voice kept telling her that she knew she wouldn't see him in the afterlife. He would be with Corellon waiting to be reincarnated and she would be barred from seeing him, she's sure that Corellon wouldn't take pity on her, she had after all been a follower of Lolth. She should have focused on atoning, she should have focused on thanking Elistreae more maybe then...maybe then... 

Getting slowly closer to the opening in the trees to the clearing she could finally see her long awaited goal, the clearing, but also in the distance there was Mosshall, she had emerged at the outer edges by the river. Looking across the river there were a group of kids running around playing in the grass chasing each other. but as soon as one of them saw her she could only guess from their expression on their face faces that they where screaming of fear at the sight of her. All of them grabbed at each other pushing back towards the town and running and looking back over their shoulders at her again and again. Someone outside of the town must have heard their screams since there now was a group of adults clad in a makeshift armour, clearly put on in a haste, running towards her. She had made it back, she sinks down on her knees having to deal with another extreme high pitch screech, this time she didn't let it stop her. For what feels like forever to get used her voice, cracked and weak from what she could guess would  be the dry feeling in her throat. Her voice not holding up the first few tries but finally she managed to utter "HELP". Last look she got before the pain takes over both her vision and hearing is as the makeshift guard group gets closer drawing their weapons but slowing in a bit after her final successful cry for help.

##### Part 2
What does dying feel like? Is it cold as a stone floor or is it warm as a bed by the fire? She always imagined dying as a greater spectacle, a lot more blood, having to watch one self be dismembered or something along those lines. but she also expected a lot more memory of what happened. Most deaths she has witness was always gory and brutal and definitely not something you would forget but she cant remember anything of what has happened. Did the exhaustion finally take her and this is the afterlife. If that is so she hopes that the afterlife and dying is like a bed by the fire, since that is the first thing she noticed when slowly opening her eyes. In that case the afterlife is also very quiet were not even the raging fire in the fireplace next to her makes any noise. 

Not wanting to leave the comfort of the bed she drags her self up in a sitting position in the bed. 
The room is simple, wooden walls in a green tinted color, a closed door, and a single window. Outside it was dark but some light source out of sight made it clear enough to understand that there is a thick fog around the house she's in. Around the room there wasn't much either, the bed she was in, the fireplace, a chair with her coat neatly folded and her weapons leaned on the wall next to the chair. Her eyes are drawn again to the silent fireplace. It looks normal, and with slow and painful movements getting out of bed, she holds her hands up to it confirming that it even feels normal. Thinking about it she also remember that the bed didn't even make any sound when getting out of it. 

Is everything like this now? Or is this her own personal hell. Never again will she be able to hear a story being told to her or a ballad sung. She goes back to the bed and sits down with defeat. Thinking back again to her last memory, but what comes up in her head is not the sight of the clearing or the sound of the screeching in her ears. Its instead the memory of Thalis again, the feeling of that cold floor, [[Characters in the stories#^8200dc | Veacaans]] fighting rage against the spirit and the pain in [[Characters in the stories#^b77604 | Rogdans]] eyes. The whole scenario playing up behind her eyes over and over again. How could she forget, tears welling up to the point of them falling silently down her cheeks. The vague memories flooding her from her days wandering in the swamp and the pain of the screeching sounds follows every memory. She spends a few moments collecting herself focusing on the idea of her finding help or at least finding some answers to where she is. Wiping away her tears and drying it off on the linnen gown shes been put into, she gets back up and heads for the door. 

Carefully grabbing the cold iron door handle and gently pushing the door just enough for her to get a peek of the outside . Peeking outside there is a lantern lit corridor to her left and to her right tall human man standing as if guarding her door. His armour matching the ones of the guard in Mosshall but not as run down as the ones the others wear. And unike the others who only had simple weapons on them he had leaned a sword to the wall right of him. Good that means she isn't dead and there is still a chance for her to go back and get the team. She carefully looks up at him trying to remember if she had seen him in the town before, but his short rat brown hair and patchy beard makes him blend in too well among the rest of the guards and general look of the cities population. He clearly is tired or distracted as he has still not noticed her, his gaze is focused on something on the floor or he is simply lost in thoughts. She opens the door a bit more and gives him a gentle, but for her still silent, knock on the metal shoulderpad. 

Him clearly not expecting anything and reacts by jumping, at what she believes to be the sound from the knocking, and grabbing his sword pulling it out half way. She swiftly backs into her new room, aiming to back towards where he weapons are stored, holding up her hands halfway into the air. But before she got very far he had already sheathed the sword again and also holding up his hands. His mouth constantly moving but still no sound and his eyes giving darting looks over his shoulder as if looking something or someone but what is clear is the panic in his eyes. At every look over the shoulder he does, she backs closer and closer to where her weapons would be along the walls. Before she reaches them the man calms down a bit and they lock eyes with each other and he stops, and points to her and then to his ears. He knows something about her hearing, could it be that she hasn't gone deaf by the screeching. She also stops, points to her self and her ears and shakes her head. He nods back at her, points to himself and to the door. Now with much more calmness on his face he takes a few slow steps towards her, gently grabbing her by her upper arms and guides her to sit down on the bed again. He turns and heads back out for the corridor giving her one last worried glance before turning his attention back to something further down the corridor. watching his face when turning in the doorway she sees that he is shouting for someone but much more she doesn't get the time to see before he has disappeared behind the door. 

Yet again she is left alone in the room, not really knowing what to do she just sits there following the patterns in the wood floor while her mind again forces her to relive the crypt moments. The little energy she had mustered had left her body and again the bed felt inviting. She crawls under the cover and nervously watches the door. If there is a guard outside her door, is she a prisoner here? No she hasn't done anything to warrant an arrest. It must be that they fear her for some reason or... protecting her from someone or something. Not before long she sees the shadows along the corridor of people approaching again. through the door a old gnome lady appears together with the guard that's holding the door open for her. The stout little lady waddles up to her bedside and looks her up and down, shakes her head making her gray braids flop around. Carefully she takes off her pointy hat placing it on the bedside table. She places her hands on her hips with a frown on her face, she continues by walking around the bed clearly mumbling something to herself until she stops on the other side. She takes out a small pouch and looks though it but not satisfied before going over to the other pouch and pulls out what could be described as dried blue moss. She crushes it up in her hand and how it mixes with small arcane particles. When done, the lady impatiently waves at her to lean in and doing so she rubs in the moss mixture on her ears. For each circle the lady does with her fingers over her ears the sound around her comes back slowly. The sound of the fire roaring in the fireplace, the sound of metal armour rustling with the nervous moves of the guard and the soft chirping from the insects outside. 

"Sorry for that lass, i had to magically deafen ye for ye to even have a wee rest. Ye did nothing but scream an hold yer ears when the guards finally delivered ye to me. Whatever ye were hearing lassie it must have been sumthing awful. So how are ye feeling now?"
The sound of the little ladys sweet voice was as a chock for Elithanas ears, after so long silence everything around seemed a bit louder.  
She was just about to answer but doesn't get the chance before the guard breaks under the nervousness.
"Miss... I'm so sorry i pulled my weapon on you, i wasn't expecting you to suddenly in the middle of the night come knocking on my armour. You have just slept for days anyway. many of us thought you'd never wake aga..."
The lady interrupts him with a loud coughing. 
"[[Characters in the stories#^83b185| Belud Nokem]]! ye stay silent now. ye dae not spread any rumors in ma hoose. Noo get out o' here, SHOO! i need some time with the lass here without yer interruptions."
The little lady shoos out the guard with him just trying to explain himself but not getting a word in before she shushes him again. The lady slams the door in behind him and brushes her hands off before turning around to her. "noo where where we, ah how yer hearing now lass"
Elithana clears her throat before she answers "it seems okay, just a bit sensitive. i also still feel a bit exhausted but i think some sleep will fix that. im guessing you have been the one taking care of me since i returned. Thank you for that is there any way i can repay you?"
The lady just laughs at Elithana, 
"ye dae not need to repay me anything. Im happy to help, its rare that i get to treat something else than simple cuts an bruises here so its been a privilege. So! i ken you'd probably want some more sleep but i ken that i'll be endlessly questioned if i dont at least get yer name an something aboot how ye ended up looking lek a overgrown will o wisp walking into our wee town."
Elithana recoils and frowns at the lady when mentioning the will o wisp. She thinks back to it all and just feel lost in where to start. she opens her mouth a few times when she thinks she has a good point to start the story at but she cant get herself to tell it. 
"lass i can tell that its a hurtful memory but lets start at the easy point, am Ginsna Eaglebym, whats yer name?" She bends down and with a loud screech drags out a small wooden step stool and firmly sits down on it. 
"Elithana Sunwalker"
"Ah! rare to meet yer kind an even rarer to meet a Sunwalker."
Elithana hops up in bed now with full attention on Ginsna. 
"have you met a Sunwalker before?"
"No, but i heard talk o' them. Had a group o' Drow show up at the outer edges o' the Swamp a few years ago, asking around for a Sunwalker that they said had gone missing some time before that. it wasn't ye by any chance?"
"Wasn't me. I haven't been with the drow for around a century now.", She sighs, "But i was here...What day is it today?"
"Thamday 10th o' Gyllip, but ye arrived here on the morning two days ago"
"I was here two weeks ago then, me and three others in my group. We refilled our supply before heading out in the swamp"
"What business did ye hev out there?"
The hesitation to keep talking was clear on Elithanas face. She stays silent a few seconds thinking over how to best retell it all without Ginsna thinking she is crazy or just a grave robber. 
"We where investigating a story about a crypt at the center of the swamp. We all entered it and was met with some undead that we killed. But at the end of the crypt was a ghostly lady," Her voice break a little "We had no chance, she killed everyone in my group. I need to get back there and fetch their bodies. Is there someone in the town that help?" 

Elithanas question goes unanswered, only reaction she got from Ginsna was her staring more intensely at Elithana the more she described the place. As soon as Elithana falls silent, Ginsna hops off the stool with such speed it falls over, still staring back at Elithana with wide eyes. She starts drawing different kinds of shapes in the air in front of her while loudly rambling on in a language she didn't understand. The commotion was enough to have the guard Belud come running in again with yet again sword drawn, screaming at them "Whats going on in here!"
Ginsna answering Belud by pointing at Elithana with a shaky hand, saying "She's been to The Specter Tombs. No one comes back alive from there. This is no' a good sign"
Belud just standing there in awe staring at Elithana. He lowers his sword and with his free hand drawing in the air the same shape as Ginsna had done.  
Looking back and fourth between Ginsna and Belud, Elithana too burst out "What is wrong with you two, what is so special about that place to you?"
Belud speaks up with a stuttering voice "Its a cursed place and no one returns from there"
"Lass what happened in there? How did ye survive the lady?"
"The lady... you knew about the ghost lady in there." Elithanas voice started out low and controlled but with time she is raising it filled with more and more anger. "you knew! We asked around everyone we could get a hold of in this town what was waiting for us out there and none of you said anything! I had to watch my friends die in there, I HAD TO WATCH MY HUSBAND DIE IN THERE" 
Belud slowly raises his sword again but now pointing it at Elithana
"lass, please calm down. Ye asked for help well ye wont be getting any from people in this town. am Sorry for yer loss but they are gone an the lady noo has them" Ginsna turns to Belud "lad sheath ye sword before ye poke an eye out, or before ye regret picking a fight with a drow"
Elithana just sits there in pure disbelief, "why cant you help me? I just want to bury them. I just want to say farewell"
"I ken lass, i ken, but the people in this town is a bit, lets say divided. Some think that the The Specter Tombs is a cursed place an shuid no' even be talked about, that's why no one helped ye. Some believe its better to feed the lady sacrifices so that the rest o' us will be safe out there in the fields. So that she or her wisps wont be coming for us. You hev really run into the most horrible people doing this to you. It would probably be best for you to leave the town as soon as possible in the morning before people start recognising you an the word spreading where you hev been."
All Elithana can do is nod back and stare down at her hands grabbing the covers of the bed. She hears how Ginsna shoos out Belud again while giving him an earful for drawing his sword again. They close the door after them and she is left in the silence that's only occasionally breaks by the sound of Belud retaking his position outside her door and moving around from time to time.

##### Part 3
She gets out of bed and looks over her gear making sure that it all is still there, her clothing, the containers filled with maps, a small box containing the ink and quill. But there was one thing among them that wasn't hers, a journal, Thalis journal to be precise. She picks it up and moves her fingers across the rough leather surface and admires its blue hue in the candlelight. It has small brass fittings on the corners except for one, when her fingers reaches that point she gets a small smile on her face at the memory of Thalis constant fidgeting with one of the fittings on the back and how it fell off. He always did tat to all his books. It was funny looking at his bundle of old journals where all of them had that same corner battered up or a slight change in color. Not even metal corners saved this one from the same fate as the others. At the bottom of the journal she saw the small braid she had made for him. Green and golden threads in a fishbone pattern and judging from its placement in the journal it was almost finished up. She should start looking for a new journal for him... But she cant now, he is gone. Whatever little happiness that memory brought her it was quickly replaced with the feeling of her heart sinking back down into the pits of her stomach. One thought echoing in her head, 'what should i do with it now?'. There should be nothing in it that would be important for her to read, it also felt a bit invasive reading it, even if he is gone she felt like she needed to respect his privacy. She should get rid of it so other cant use it to find that awful place. She moves over to the fireplace staring into the flames for a long time, hands grabbing the journal tighter for every minute looking at the fire. Looking back at the book she spots water droplets on it, she looks up towards the ceiling thinking its the rain leaking in but there is nothing. She drags her fingertips on her cheek and looking at them she had found the source of the water. She goes back to the table and removes a small belt from the map containers, wraps it around the journal, and neatly pack it into her backpack. She returns back to the bed, curls up into a ball, as if it would protect her now broken heart. Here she finally lets all of her feeling out for the first time. Screaming and crying into the pillows until there where no more tears that would come out.
