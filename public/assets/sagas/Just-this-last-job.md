Elithana never thought she would find the final resting place of the dagger. Something her party had searched for over 8 years. And now they were finally here in front of the crypt. Imagine that such a powerful weapon would be hidden away in an old overlooked crypt in the middle of a swamp. No wonder the locals never had known peace, the mere power from that weapon must have attracted countless monstrosities or hauntings. They had made sure to travel during the day there since the locals had warned them about what crawled out at night. They had reached the crypt at the end of the day and the sun setting behind the trees to their west.  

While Veacaan  was struggling to get the door loose she took the <br/> opportunity to sit down with Thalis. 
"what do you think we will find in there," she asked while making herself comfortable on a rock in the less swampy area. <br/>
"We can never know for sure but if the books are correct we can at least expect some skeletons. Locals have seen them wander around the area for years. I think it could originate from this spot, the air has felt strange the closer we get, something dead and arcane in the air." 

Just as he finished his sentence Veacaan ripped the old door off to the catacombs with a loud roar, throwing it to the side. Everyone went completely quiet, nothing could be heard except for Rogdans slow sharpening of his knives. Rogdan hopped off the stone he had been sitting on and neatly packed away the sharpening kit. Unlike normally where Rogdans hands would be steady, she saw a slight shake in them. He was clearly fighting against his emotions. Looking over the others she could tell everyone seemed to be a bit on edge. To see Rogdan be this unsettled was a worrying thing, he was always a calm and secure presence to be around. 

She felt how Thalis took her hand and squeezed it to get her attention and gave it a quick kiss. <br/>
"It will be fine," he said with a smile. that smile that had always completely charmed her. Towards everyone else he usually had a stern look about him, as if he was always angry or contemplating something whenever he turned and smiled at her, she always got the feeling of butterflies in her stomach. Thalis had made the promise that this was the last adventure they would go on before they found a good city with the mages league and finally settle down together. No more muddy camping spots, or long days walking from village to village. Even the thought of always having access to a hot bath was a dream come true. They had even discussed if they should return to the college they met at, in Kalderra to become teachers. She could teach art and its history and he could teach about his own findings about necromancy magic around the world. Both of them had enough real world experience with it to be adequately qualified which made it all a much more tempting idea. 

Veacaan unsheathed his sword and took the lead into the tomb with Rogdan close behind, 'the unstoppable duo' she thought, this small crypt woudlnt't be a problem for them, she had seen those two go through hoards of monsters together without even a scratch. She gave Thalis a quick worried smile before she got up from her rock and followed Veacaan and Rogdan into the tomb..

It didn't really look like what they had expected inside the crypt, it began with stone stairs leading down into a long corridor with walls made out of smooth dark stone. Along the walls there were many coffins neatly placed into sockets in the walls. They were made both out of now-murky wood and the same kind of dark stone as the walls. Many of the dead inside them had woken up by their presence but it was surprisingly easy to dispose of them again. Thalis was correct in the reports of skeletons roaming around but they didn't expect there to even be a few wraiths commanding a small group of spectres. After every skeleton or wraith was put to rest Thalis made sure to look closely at the graves, and if there were any names, he noted them down. Even the graves where there where only a few letters on them or only dates, he made notes of it. 

At the end of the corridor there was a massive decorated iron door. Text weaved around itself in a serpentine pattern along the edges of its frame. The door had turned into a blotchy red stained color and where there probably once had been door handles was now only a small broken off stump. Veacaan and Rogdan started working on how to open it and see if there were any traps. Thalis walked up to the door and took notes of what the text on it said. She took a quick look at it but it was no language she understood. But the idea of her and Thalis spending the coming evenings with some good drinks and studying the text excited her. While the others were working with the door she had a look around the room. There was nothing out of the ordinary except for the now-empty graves. But when walking around the corridor she kept on thinking that she saw a blue glow in the corner of her eyes but every time she turned around to look there was nothing. And it was different spots every time, sometimes it was on the door itself and sometimes it was as if deep behind the coffins.

After some time the door lit up in a faint glow.<br/>
"What did you two do?" said Thalis.<br/>
"Absolutely nothing we were just discussing if we should melt the hinges," answered Rogdan while both him and Veacaan backed slowly away from the door. Elithana quickly joined up and stood behind Thalis and all of them together watched as the door slowly opened. They had to shield their eyes as the glow coming from the room was as bright as daylight and their eyes weren’t used to it after all the time in the darkness.

They all slowly entered the room "that unlike the others, had rough walls and what looked like natural light flowing into it. She thought about where it came from she considered them lucky to have arrived on a full moon, without its light, they would have seen nothing in here. The floor was packed dirt unlike the other rooms that had stone. At the point on the floor where the natural light shone in there was stone spikes rising up from the ground, resembling almost a hand.Its fingers were twisted and rigid, forming a chair.. But at one of the points sticking up from the chair there was the prize they had been looking for all this time. the dagger... Rakdos Riteknife. Rogdan slowly walked up towards the chair absolutely entranced by it, reaching out his hand towards the knife. Before Thalis even got a word out to stop Rogdan from touching it, something glowing formed in the chair. A mix of blue electric sparks and glowing small orbs rapidly flew around anda figure faded in, sitting in the chair. It was a ghost, a woman with long silvery hair flying upward from the static in the air. There was no way to see how she had died just from looking at her but her face still showed some pain and sadness. 

One after another, the ghost looked around at all of the party members, pointing a finger at each one of them."None of them in the room did anything, all they could do was stand there and watch her. All of them acted as if making the slightest movement her finger would stop on them and target them. When she finished with a final point at Elithana, the ghost rose and held her arms out and "will-o'-the-wisps faded in all around the room. 'This must have been the lights I saw,' Elithana thought. There were so many in the room that it was getting difficult for Elithana to see anything because of the brightness. She looked back at the others in the party, then at the ghost. They were all distracted looking at all of the will-o' wisps, following them as they danced around them. It was a beautiful sight, like watching falling stars that never stopped falling. But what they didn't notice was the one small thread that now connected them. Rogdan was connected to Veacaan, who was connected to Thalis. Elithana saw the will-o'-the-wisp with the thin thread fly out from Thalis’s back over to her. She tried to wave her hand towards it to get it to fly in a different path but her hand only passed through it, leaving a burning cold feeling. Elithana shoved her hand inside her coat, warming it against her body. She could do nothing more but to watch the wisp pass through her chest with a small, cold sting in her heart. At that moment all other wisps faded away leaving only the thin blue thread linking them all together.

A zap went through her body, and she saw that all the others also froze. All she could do was move her eyes and look around. The wisp came back, now at the beginning of the thread near Rogdan. It just hung there in the air, waiting, until the ghostly lady waved a hand at it, and it started moving along the line.It passed through Rogdan, but he could do nothing-not even scream. He just stood there, the pain from the wisp still visible in his eyes. When the wisp left his body, he collapsed to the floor. There was no sign of life. Did the wisp kill him? No, that can't be, Rogdan would be ready-he's always ready for things like this. He's just passed out. From his body, a smaller wisp emerged and flew over to the ghost before disappearing in a small poof of sparks.

The wisp now continued along the thread into Veacaan, but when it entered him, it didn't have the same effect as it had on Rogdan. When the wisp exited his body he didn't fall to the ground but instead he regained control of his body, steadied himself so he too, didn't fall to the ground. He took a deep breath and breathed out a cloud of necromantic magic at the ghost, he ended it with a few coughs. Elithana could clearly tell that the wisps effect on him was still bad as he continues in struggling breathing. And with each breath he took, it became more rapid and raspy, until he had to get down on all fours, just coughing. The attack on the ghost did nothing but to anger it, she grasped the dagger, flew over to Veacaan, and stabbed him in the back while he was down. Turquoise cracks appeared all over him spreading up to his neck and face, before she removed the blade, his limbs gave out and he collapsed to the ground. All Elithana could do was stare at Veacaan on the floor, wishing that he would get back up. This time, no wisp exited the body. With the actions of the spirit lady, it became unbearably clear to her what was about to happen. She needed to get out of here before it reached Thalis. She needed to fight against it. No matter what she did, she couldn't move a single limb. She was still frozen in a perfect position, forced to watch the horrors before her.She even attempted to scream or cast spells, but her lips wouldn't part, and the best result she got was a slight quivering and sweat beading on her forehead.

The ghost returned the knife to the spot where it had floated before and sat down again. She waved her hand towards the wisp on the thread and it continued towards Thalis. Elithana’s eyes started filling with tears at that moment, she knew what was waiting for him, and she knew she was next and there was nothing she could do.No matter how much she tried to fight the spell that froze her, she couldn't break free. From where Elithana was standing, she couldn't see Thalis’s face, he, too, was frozen in place. She followed the small wisp along its thread with her eyes and when it reached Thalis, it had the same effect as it had on Rogdan, it exited his body and Thalis fell to the ground. At this point Elithana could barely see anything at all because of all the tears filling her eyes. She only saw the glow from the small wisp following the thin thread from Thalis’s body to her own. The small glowing ball felt like it took an eternity to reach her, but that eternity gave her long enough to think about how at least she and Thalis would die together. She wouldn’t have been able to live on without him-this was the better outcome. She turned her eyes to where Thalis now laid on the floor and thought, ‘See you soon’. As the wisp entered her body and with a cold gripping her heart, everything turned black - then nothing. 

She woke up to the cold dirt floor pressing against her cheek. The room was now dark and no wisps or ghost anywhere to be seen. Wasn't she dead? She had been certain that the cold that gripped her heart was enough to stop it. Looking around she could see the rough shadows of other bodies in the dark. She tried to get up but her entire body was stiff and unwilling to obey her. With a painful crawl she got over to Thalis to check if he had also survived. The stench of rotting, however, forced her to cover her nose with her arm. She avoided looking at his face for fear of remembering it in such a state. Feeling around on the ground on her way out of the room she comes across something soft and rectangular. She remembered Thalis holding his notebook in his hand as they walked into the room. He must've dropped it. Elithana picked it up, clutching it to her chest as she got off the ground. She took a quick glance at each of her friends' silhouettes. A thought of helping them flashed through her mind, but fearing the return of the ghost lady, she decided to run, and, to her surprise, the door out was still open. When she left the tomb she was met by darkness, though they had arrived on a full moon now there was no moon to be seen. With the lack of moonlight to give her any sense of direction, she made an estimated guess and turned toward the way she thought they had come from and slowly started walking back to Mosshall.
