Elithana never thought she would they would find the final resting place of the dagger. Something they had searched for over 8 years and now they are finally here in front of the crypt. Imagine that such a powerful weapon would be stuck in an old glanced over crypt in the middle of a swamp. No wonder the locals never got to have a calm moment, the mere power from that weapon must attract countless monstrosities or hauntings. The made sure to travel during the day there since the locals warned them about what crawled out at night. They had reached the crypt at the end of the day and the sun had just started to set behind the trees to their west. 

While Veacaan was fighting to get the door loose she took the <br/>opportunity to sit down with Thalis. 
"what do you think we will find in there," she said while making herself comfortable on a rock in the less swampy area. <br/>
"We can never know for sure but if the books are correct we can at least expect some skeletons. Locals have seen them wander around the area for years. I think it could originate from this spot, the air has felt strange the closer we get, something dead and arcane in the air." 

Just as he finished his sentence Veacaan ripped off the old door to the catacombs with a loud roar, throwing it to the side. Everyone went completely quiet, nothing could be heard except for Rogdans slow sharpening of his knives. Rogdan hopped off the stone he was sitting on and neatly packed away the sharpening kit.  Unlike normally where Rogdans hands would be steady, she could see a slight shake in them. He was clearly fighting against his emotions. Looking over the others she can tell everyone seems to be a bit on edge. To see Rogdan be this much on edge was a worrying thing, he was always a calm and secure spot to be around. 

She felt how Thalis took her hand and squeezed it to get her attention and gave it a quick kiss. <br/>
"It will be fine," he said with a smile. that smile that always completely charmed her. Towards everyone else he usually had a stern look about him, as if he is always angry about something but when he turns and smiles to her she always gets the feeling of butterflies in her stomach. Thalis had made the promise that this was the last adventure they go on before they find a good city with the mages league and finally settle down together. No more muddy camping spots, or long days walking from village to village. Even the thought of always having access to a hot bath was a dream come true. They even discussed a bit if they should return to the collage they met at to become teachers. She could teach art and its history and he could teach about his own findings about necromancy magic around the world. Both of them had enough real world experience with it to be adequately qualified which made it all a much more tempting idea.
